I built this chat app by following along with this youtube tutorial: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKhlp2qtUcSZsGkxAdgnPcHioRr-4guZf

This app is deployed to Render (https://chat-app-b4at.onrender.com).

I have recently learned the MERN stack and wanted to apply what I have learned in a more complex project. However, since I am still very inexperienced, I decided to follow along with a youtube tutorial. 

From this project, I learned a lot about websockets and socket.io, and how they provide realtime data transfer to and from the server. I also learned a lot about mongodb and how to use refs and populate. express routers and controllers were also introduced, which allowed me to write cleaner code.

I have gained some experience from this project and hope to be able to become a more proficient fullstack developer in the future :)
